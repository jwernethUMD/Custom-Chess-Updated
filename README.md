# Frontend for Custom Chess

Play Custom Chess [here](https://custom-chess-jw.vercel.app/)  
Backend Source Code: https://github.com/jwernethUMD/Custom-Chess-Backend

# Instructions for Running Locally
Note that you will not be able to do much by just running the frontend, aside from singleplayer, so also run the backend using the instructions found in the backend source code.
1. Pull the repository onto your machine.
2. Type "npm i" into the command bar to install dependencies.
3. Change "baseURL" in files that have it to your backend URL.
4. Type "npm start" into the command bar. The frontend should now be running locally on your machine!

# Project Notes
- The site is currently susceptible to cheating, as this project was originally only on the frontend. Thus, most of the logic for it was on the frontend and still is. In the future, I am looking to move this logic, especially the move validation, to the backend.
- There may be bugs within the program at the moment. Feel free to create an Issue if your notice any!
